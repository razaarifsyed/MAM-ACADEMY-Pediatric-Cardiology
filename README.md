# MAM Academy : Pediatric Cardiology -  User End App(Not the Admin app)
------------
This is the draft app of the original one. Its an e-learnng app that I built for a Pediatric Cardiologist.
This app will be used by him to offer his teaching services online.

The app offer features like lecture videos, lecture resources, messaging, auto-emailing, notices, forums, comments on video. Also has account management features like login-signup, my profile, logout etc.



I intend this app to be an opensource project. You are welcome to borrow my code, or contribute to this project.
Let me know if you found my project helpful.

Thank you
